# Cube-Op

Game can be played here: https://simmer.io/@mrchrissross/cube-op

Cube-Op was developed along side my BSc (Hons) dissertation to find out what the effects of simplifying 
first person shooter controls has on player experience. Originally this game was a first-person shooter, however it 
has now been updated with numerous new features. 

The visual appearance of both the player and menu scene have been improved in the latest update and the player also has a much lower poly count:
